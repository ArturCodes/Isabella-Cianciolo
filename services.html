                    <h1>CONSULTATIONS</h1>
                    <p>Astrology is meant to be an ongoing conversation. The chart is ever evolving, as are you and I.
                        These dynamics continue to create new potentials that can be seen in the chart. Co-creating with
                        the universe is a beautiful, lifetime commitment. Each consultation will unravel new dynamics
                        that may not have been present, or relevant, during previous conversations. The intention is to
                        bring a sense of grounding and mindfulness to the present moment, in order to meet yourself
                        where you are and empower you to actively participate in the course of your own life, rather
                        than waiting for something to happen.
