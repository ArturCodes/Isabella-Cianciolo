                    <h1>THE LANGUAGE OF THE COSMOS</h1>
                    <p>Astrology is a language. Each person will interpret it differently, and there are endless nuances
                        to
                        how we can experience the symbolism that lies within the birthchart. Astrology is also a
                        co-creative
                        process, inviting us to work with the symbolism of the cosmos to actualize our own creative path
                        forward. This allows us the opportunity to more consciously engage with our lived experiences
                        through a broadening understanding of our innate nature, our desires, our goals, our
                        conditioning,
                        and the relationships that we experience with others. The natal chart is the template for
                        understanding the soul. Through introspection, we can become more aware of our unconscious
                        tendencies and begin to gently meet ourselves through a more objective lens. </p>
                    <p>I use astrology as a tool to help facilitate a conversation that, hopefully, leads to
                        enlightenment
                        and empowerment. Through an observation of the energies affecting the natal chart in the present
                        moment, we can discuss the developmental themes that are at play and begin to explore how they
                        are
                        manifesting within your world. Every moment of every day is unique, offering new ways to engage
                        with
                        our lives. Astrology can help to provide guidance through offering a suggestive template of the
                        times.</p>
                    <p>Free will remains with each of us.</p>
                    <p>The planets are never doing anything to us, but rather reflecting the current moment through
                        evocative symbolism that embodies the collective experiences shared by all. For example, every
                        human
                        has shared in the experience of having the opportunity to nurture something (another human, an
                        animal, a plant, the Self, etc). These types of shared archetypal human experiences are what the
                        planets represent, and the zodiac delineates the ways in which we can engage with these
                        developmental processes in our own unique ways, creating a guidebook for becoming more conscious
                        of
                        our own, authentic path. </p>
