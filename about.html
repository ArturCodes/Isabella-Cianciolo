                    <h1>About My Practice</h1>
                    <p>I practice modern, humanistic astrology, focusing on creating a therapeutic healing space that
                        allows for the conversation to emphasize your lived experiences and how they have shaped the
                        expression of your potential as seen through the birthchart. I encourage new clients to tell me
                        about themselves and what brings them to the session, so that we can have a co-creative
                        conversation around where you are in this moment in time, utilizing the birthchart for context.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is important to note that I am not a licensed therapist, but a student of psychology receiving
                        psychotherapy and mentorship from licensed psychotherapists. Each conversation is
                        transformative— those that I have within my own therapy as well as those that I have with
                        clients through consultations. Astrology is a beautifully reflective tool that opens up a deeper
                        connection to ourselves, as well as others. We'll focus our conversation on which developmental
                        lessons are active at this time in your life based on what you’re experiencing, and we’ll
                        discuss how you might engage with these situations in a matter that reflects and honors your
                        core needs and values. </p>
                    <p>With astrology, everything is potential— nothing is determined. There are endless variations of
                        the same theme that will emerge, but each moment in time is uniquely separate from the last,
                        offering new opportunities to engage with the cycles of life. The purpose of my sessions are to
                        illuminate the archetypal potentials that exist during this period of transformation, to leave
                        you to further reflect on what resonates with you within the deepest aspects of your soul. The
                        final decision should always be made by yourself, not the practitioner. Listen to what resonates
                        in your heart, for it is your life to live, and you alone uniquely inhabit this moment in time.
                    </p>

                    <h1>ABOUT ME </h1>
                    <p>A graduate of the very first cohort of Astrology University’s four year professional astrologer
                        training program, as well as one of the original Teaching Assistants for the program, I’ve been
                        blessed with many opportunities to learn from and work with some of the most highly regarded and
                        inspirational astrologers in the field, such as Tony Howard, Mark Jones, Kelly Surtees, and
                        Safron Rossi, among many others. I am particularly influenced by the writings and work of
                        Stephen Arroyo, Liz Greene, Howard Sasportas, and Steven Forrest. I’ve been studying astrology
                        since 2019.</p>
                    <p>Originally graduating with a Bachelor’s of Science in Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular
                        Genetics from UCLA in 2017, my early career was spent in scientific research and navigating the
                        business world of healthcare. More recently, I’ve transitioned into direct patient caregiving,
                        working as a psychiatric aide in the intensive care unit of an inpatient mental health facility,
                        where I work alongside a team responsible for maintaining the safety and security of people
                        experiencing psychiatric crises. </p>
                    <p>A Libra Sun, Taurus Moon, and Cancer Rising, I delight in connecting with others through
                        cultivating warm, comfortable environments. I enjoy cooking, nature, spending time with animals,
                        and long conversations exploring the depths of our human experiences while snuggled into the
                        corner of a cozy couch with a comfy blanket. Born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri, I now
                        live in Saint Paul, Minnesota – I’m midwestern to my core. </p>
                    <p>My intention is to use astrology to help others feel empowered with their own life decisions.
                        Through understanding one’s unique journey, separate from familial and societal conditioning, we
                        can start to feel more connected to our own purpose. I use astrology to help you find your own
                        answers; those that already lie within. Through examining your innate nature, as well as the
                        conditions that are currently influencing your life, we can work together to create a sense of
                        structure and support so that you may feel more clarity. I am especially interested in family
                        dynamics and the process of self-individuation. 1:1 consultations are the best way to hold a
                        creative, healing space to explore these inner dynamics. I hope that you choose to participate
                        in this beautiful transformational process with me. </p>
