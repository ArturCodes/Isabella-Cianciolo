                    <h1>About My Practice</h1>
                    <p>I practice modern, humanistic astrology, focusing on creating a therapeutic healing space that
                        allows for the conversation to emphasize your lived experiences and how they have shaped the
                        expression of your potential as seen through the birthchart. I encourage new clients to tell me
                        about themselves and what brings them to the session, so that we can have a co-creative
                        conversation around where you are in this moment in time, utilizing the birthchart for context.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is important to note that I am not a licensed therapist, but a student of psychology receiving
                        psychotherapy and mentorship from licensed psychotherapists. Each conversation is
                        transformative— those that I have within my own therapy as well as those that I have with
                        clients through consultations. Astrology is a beautifully reflective tool that opens up a deeper
                        connection to ourselves, as well as others. We'll focus our conversation on which developmental
                        lessons are active at this time in your life based on what you’re experiencing, and we’ll
                        discuss how you might engage with these situations in a matter that reflects and honors your
                        core needs and values. </p>
                    <p>With astrology, everything is potential— nothing is determined. There are endless variations of
                        the same theme that will emerge, but each moment in time is uniquely separate from the last,
                        offering new opportunities to engage with the cycles of life. The purpose of my sessions are to
                        illuminate the archetypal potentials that exist during this period of transformation, to leave
                        you to further reflect on what resonates with you within the deepest aspects of your soul. The
                        final decision should always be made by yourself, not the practitioner. Listen to what resonates
                        in your heart, for it is your life to live, and you alone uniquely inhabit this moment in time.
                    </p>
